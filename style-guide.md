#### Font weights

Rubik - Weights [300, 400, 600, 800]

or copy the link tags below and paste them in your app.

```

<link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.gstatic.com">
<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Rubik:wght@300;400;600;800&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">

```

The font weights are outlined as follows:
h1 - 800
h2 - 400
h3, h4 - 600
p - 300

#### Font size

h1 - 72px on extra large screens - change this to behave as you want for smaller screens.
h2 - 56px on extra large screens - change this to behave as you want for smaller screens.
h3 - 32 px on extra large screens - change this to behave as you want for smaller screens.
h4 - 24px on extra large screens - change this to behave as you want for smaller screens.

### Designs

I made the desktop design for 1600px (which is what I'm referring to as extra large screens) and the iPad/Tablet design is for 768px and finally 375px for mobile phones.

### Images

All the assets and images are available in this folder. All you have to do is clone the repository.

### Data arrays

In the `data` folder you will find data arrays that you can use in your design. NOTE: I created the data arrays with React in mind so feel free to change them to whatever you want.
