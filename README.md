# Challenge Time

- I'm offering up a challenge - build out this design in whatever language you want, whichever you think is best for the job, whichever you are comfortable with and when you are done, tag me on Twitter @TSBSankara and I will go through it live on my YouTube stream and credit you with the build.
- Feel free to change all the parts you feel are sub par in terms of text for example so that you can use it in your portfolio as a side project you built - or you can even use the same design for your own portfolio.

### The challenge

The challenge is simple:

- Build out this design in whatever programming language you want - just get it as close as you can to the design.
- You can add whatever you want to the design such as more pages in the app, or animations for text and images, and I encourage you to do so to make it your own design.
- For the purpose of the challenge, please don't change anything in the design - this is just for the challenge.
- You are free to use the same design for your portfolio or anywhere else you want or to showcase your finished 'Design to code' in your portfolio.
- If you're not taking the challenge, you can change and add or remove anything you want in the design - once again I reiterate, that if you're going to participate in the project, please don't change anything just so that all the submissions can be uniform. Thank you for understanding.

### Submissions

Once you are done, deploy your project to netlify or vercel and then tag me on Twitter @TSBSankara with the link to your project. I will then take a look at all the submissions and review them on a future livestream.

### Winners

Winners will be announced on Twitter, and in a video after the submissions have come in, and they will receive a free copy of my eBook.

Thank you, and let's get going!

## BONUS Challenge

- Build upon the design. For example, I don't have any other pages in the design - not to say that you have to have other pages - but add something to it to make it your own such as adding a CMS like Contentful or Sanity or Netlify CMS to handle blogging and add some content to the blog to make it active. If you find a creative way to improve on it then I will personally email you a free copy of my eBook!
- So let's get to coding! I will do a livestream of me building this out on my YouTube channel [tsbsankara](https://youtube.com/tsbsankara)
